# BlackJackProject



# Overview
-In the BlackJackProject the user is prompted to play the card game BlackJack, by entering (1) the user will start the game<br>
resulting in the Dealer dealing one face up card to the player, then one face down card to itself, then another face up card to the<br>
user, and a face up card to itself. The game then checks the value of the players hand and if the player doesn't have a total of twenty-one<br>
points the player will be prompted to either receive another card or stand. if the User stands the dealer will then check if the value of<br>
of the Dealer's hand is below seventeen, if the value is then the Dealer will add another card to their hand until the value is over seventeen. The game<br>
will check both BlackJackHand values to determine first if either player or dealer have a value of twenty-one then which player had the highest value under<br>
twenty-one and decides the winner or a case of a tie.<br>
Once a round of BlackJack is completed the user is prompted to play again if the user enters (1) the deck is counted, if the deck has 8 or less cards<br>
a new shuffled deck is introduced and, both player and dealer's hands are discarded. if the user enters (2) the program is terminated.

# Lessons Learned
During this project I learned the importance of always closing what you open<br>
and don't be scared to start over again.<br>
I underestimated this project and started with minimal planning which resulted in having to rewrite<br>
a significant portion of my code, the importance of making a plan and working a single step at a time<br>
became very clear, very quickly.<br>
I did farther work on compartmentalizing methods and practicing proper encapsulation of classes and their fields.<br>
while using objects as fields as well as exposing me to enums.<br>
